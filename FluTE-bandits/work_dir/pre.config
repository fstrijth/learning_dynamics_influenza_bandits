#Vector of 13 priorities,
#the 5 last entries encompass age-specific priorities:
#all preschoolers, all school-age children, all young adults, 
#all older adults, all elderly.
#Priorities are determined numerically:
#a value of 1 indicates highest priority, 2 is the next-highest priority, etc. 
#0 indicates that this category is not prioritized to get vaccine.
#In this script, we are interested in targeting a combination of these 
#age groups to prioritize.
#These can be controlled by passing a comma separated vector of numerals.
